[Advent of Code](advent) is a cool series of math and logic puzzles to practice programming.

I am doing Advent of Code in Hoon because I haven't written any non-trivial Hoon programs before and this is a way to try stuff out in a small and iterative way.

Hoon, and Urbit development more generally, doesn't seem to have a lot of best-practices established, when it comes to developer experience and workflow.  I'm clearly not an expert on the topic, but on the other hand, it doesn't seem like many people are.  The overall volume of Hoon code being produced worldwide is low, and aside from Urbit itself, there are hardly any large projects that use Hoon or are built on Urbit.  This means there aren't any established patterns that I, as a new Hoon developer, can copy.

Therefore, I will make up my own.  I think this can be a good practice in general.  Many software idioms that are established by giant megacorps are inappropriate for smaller projects.  Copying them isn't always a good idea, unless you're sure that your use case is exactly the same as theirs.
